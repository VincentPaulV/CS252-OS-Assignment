## What are System Calls?
System Calls are the programming interface to the services provided by the Operating System.

Generally being written in C or C++ most of the System Calls are accessed by programs via a high level Application Program Interface (API) rather than directy using the system call.

>In fact even *printf()* in C Language is an API to call *write()* in UNIX systems or *WriteFile()* in Windows

### System Call Implementation:

Typically a number is associated with each system call and **System Call Interface** maintains a table indexed according to these numbers.
