## What are System calls?
System Calls are the programming interface to the services provided by the Operating System.

They are generally written in C or C++

Most of the System Calls are accessed by programs via a high level Application Program Interface (API) rather than directy using the system call.
>In fact even *printf()* is an API to call *write()* in UNIX systems or *WriteFile()* in Windows
